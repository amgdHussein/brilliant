      Last month, I had the incredible honor of winning Singapore's first ever GPT-4 Prompt Engineering competition, which brought together over 400 prompt-ly brilliant participants, organised by the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech).
      Prompt engineering is a discipline that blends both art and science â€” it is as much technical understanding as it is of creativity and strategic thinking. This is a compilation of the prompt engineering strategies I learned along the way, that push any LLM to do exactly what you need and more!    
      Author's Note:
      In writing this, I sought to steer away from the traditional prompt engineering techniques that have already been extensively discussed and documented online. Instead, my aim is to bring fresh insights that I learned through experimentation, and a different, personal take in understanding and approaching certain techniques. I hope you'll enjoy reading this piece!
